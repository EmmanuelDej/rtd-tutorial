   * **Grace Cluster Status:** Cluster deployed, currently in testing and early user access mode. 

**Getting an Account**
================

   * **Understanding HPRC:** For a brief overview of what services HPRC offers, see `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfqtDigwgMg&list=PLHR4HLly3i4YrkNWcUE77t8i-AkwN5AN8>`_ in our getting started series on YouTube.

   * **New to HPRC's resources?** `This page <https://hprc.tamu.edu/resources/>`_ explains the HPRC resources available to the TAMU community. Also see the `Policies Page <https://hprc.tamu.edu/policies/>`_ to better understand the rules and etiquette of cluster usage..

   * **Accessing the clusters:** All computer systems managed by the HPRC are available for use to TAMU faculty, staff, and students who require large-scale computing capabilities. The HPRC hosts the `Ada <https://hprc.tamu.edu/wiki/Ada>`_ , `Terra <https://hprc.tamu.edu/wiki/Terra>`_ , and `Grace <https://hprc.tamu.edu/wiki/Grace:Intro>`_  clusters at TAMU. To apply for or renew an HPRC account, please visit the `Account Applications <https://hprc.tamu.edu/apply/>`_  page. For information on how to obtain an allocation to run jobs on one of our clusters, please visit the `Allocations Policy <https://hprc.tamu.edu/policies/allocations.html>`_  page. *All accounts expire and must be renewed in September of each year.*

**Using The Clusters**
================
   * **QuickStart Guides:** For just the "need-to-know" information on getting started with our clusters, visit our QuickStart pages. Topics discussed include cluster access, file management, the batch system, setting up a software environment using modules, creating your own job files, and project account management. `Grace Quickstart Guide <https://hprc.tamu.edu/wiki/Grace:QuickStart>`_ , `Terra Quickstart Guide <https://hprc.tamu.edu/wiki/Terra:QuickStart>`_ .

   * **Batch Jobs:** As a shared resource between many users, each cluster must employ a batch system to schedule a time for each user's job to run. Without such a system, one user could use a disproportionate amount of resources, and cause other users' work to stall. Ada's batch system is called LSF, and Terra's batch system is called SLURM. While similar in function, they differ in their finer details, such as job file syntax. Information relevant to each system can be found below.
