What is TAMU HPRC OnDemand Portal
---------------------------------
The TAMU HPRC OnDemand portal is based on `Open OnDemand <https://openondemand.org/>`_ , an open source web platform through which users can access HPC clusters and 
services with a web browser. The portal provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface and allows new users to be instantly productive at using the HPC resources 
for their research, and at the same time, provides an alternative convenient way for experienced users to access the HPC resources. The portal has a flexible and 
extensible design that makes it easy to deploy new services as needed.
