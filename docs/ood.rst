OOD Portal
==========
What is TAMU HPRC OnDemand Portal
---------------------------------
The TAMU HPRC OnDemand portal is based on `Open OnDemand <https://openondemand.org/>`_ , an open source web platform through which users can access HPC clusters and 
services with a web browser. The portal provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface and allows new users to be instantly productive at using the HPC resources 
for their research, and at the same time, provides an alternative convenient way for experienced users to access the HPC resources. The portal has a flexible and 
extensible design that makes it easy to deploy new services as needed.

How to Access
-------------
We recommend you access the Grace or Terra portal through their landing page at

      https://portal.hprc.tamu.edu
      
Click the portal you want to connect. The portals are CAS authenticated. All active HPRC users have access to both portals using their NetID and password. You will only be authenticated once, and before your session expires, you can freely access both portals without further authentication.

If accessing from off-campus, the TAMU VPN is needed.

You can go directly to the Grace or Terra portal using one of the following URLs:

  https://portal-terra.hprc.tamu.edu
  
  https://portal-grace.hprc.tamu.edu

Two-Factor Authentication Requirement
-------------------------------------
Starting October 1, 2018, the Division of Information Technology will require use of Duo NetID Two Factor Authentication on its Virtual Private Network (VPN) (connect.tamu.edu) service.

Duo provides a second layer of security to Texas A&M accounts.


If you are not already enrolled in Duo and plan to use VPN, you can enroll now at duo.tamu.edu. Enrolling is as easy as 1-2-3:

#. Choose your device and download the Duo Mobile app. (We strongly recommend the mobile app as the most user-friendly option.)

#. Start your enrollment at https://gateway.tamu.edu/duo-enroll/;

#. Remember: Once you sign up, you will need your Duo-enrolled device when you log in to most Texas A&M resources.
